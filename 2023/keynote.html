						<p><b>Title</b>: From Grid to Cloud - From Edge to ??</p>
						<p><b>Abstract:</b> Grid Computing envisoned easing the use of heterogeneous, distributed resources by providing a ubiquitous, simple abstraction analog to a power outlet. Although there has been substantial research, success was limited. This changed with the advent of cloud computing. Virtualization as abstraction works well for users as well as in the operation of data centers.  Looking at the current situation in Edge computing, this hints a similar development.  After more a decade of research, platforms and algorithms have been researched but major deployments are still not visible. In this talk I want to present two  fundamental application models, rehearse approaches and propose yet another possible architecture for Edge Computing.</p>

						<p><b>Bio</b>: Christian Becker is a full professor for Computer Science at the University of Stuttgart since April 2022. Prior to that he was a full professor for Information Systems at the University of Mannheim from 2006 till 2022. Christian studied Computer Science at the Universities of Karlsruhe and Kaiserslautern where he graduated in 1996. He received his PhD from the University of Frankfurt in 2001. In 2001 he joined the distributed systems group at the University of Stuttgart as PostDoc. In 2004 he received the venia legendi (Habilitation) for Computer Science (Informatik). Christian's research interests are Distributed Systems and Context-Aware Computing. He is specifically interested in architectures for adaptive systems and their application to distributed systems. Christian has published more than 200 technical papers. He is a member of the IEEE Pervasive Computing and Communication Conference (PerCom) steering committee. Christian is active in the community, e.g., he was general chair of IEEE PerCom in 2010, TPC chair in 2016. He was/is general chair of IEEE Mobile Data Management in 2007 and 2023 and contributed to many other scientific venues.</p>

						<!--- <p><b>Keynote</b>:  Building Vision-Language AI Applications in Practice</p> --->
						<p><b>Bio</b>: Dr. Maarten Sierhuis is VP/Alliance Global Director of the Alliance Innovation Lab in Silicon Valley. In this role he leads the Silicon Valley lab's research & advanced engineering functions. Previously, as Chief Technology Director, Sierhuis led a team of researchers tasked with developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles and Human-Machine Interaction and Interfaces (HMI²) to help shape the future of intelligent cars capable of driving themselves. Prior to Nissan, Sierhuis spent 12 years at NASA where he created a computer language that was used to develop an intelligent system for all communication between Mission Control and the International Space Station. He also developed an autonomous system to monitor and give advice to astronauts during spacewalks. Sierhuis joined Nissan in 2013. In a career in research and software engineering spanning 25 years, Sierhuis has also worked at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, NYNEX Science & Technology, IBM Corporation, and as a founder of startup Ejenta, as well as a visiting professor and fellow with the Interactive Intelligence group Delft University of Technology in Netherlands. Sierhuis earned a bachelor degree in Computer Science from The Hague University and a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence/Cognitive Science from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands. He is based in Sunnyvale, California.</p>

					<b>Title:</b> Clubs, Coins, and Crowds: Fairness and Decentralization in Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies
				</div>
				<div class="row text-justify">
					<b>Abstract:</b> Building secure systems from independent, mutually distrustful parties is an old topic in computer science. But despite its attendant hype and misinformation, today's “blockchain bandwagon” has successfully brought the gospel of decentralization - both a realization of its possibility and an appreciation for its value - to mainstream society.  Currently-deployed blockchains, however, are slow, unscalable, weakly consistent, profligate in energy use, and have effectively re-centralized due to market pressures.  We will explore ongoing challenges and progress in rethinking blockchain architecture to improve scalability, efficiency, functionality, privacy, and decentralization.  We will explore how decentralized building blocks such as collective signatures and scalable distributed randomness enable architecturally modular solutions to challenges such as sharding, proof-of-stake, and blockchain-managed secrets.  Finally, we explore challenges in fairness and democratization in decentralized systems, how “proof-of-personhood” blockchains could enable information forums and anonymous reputation systems resistant to propaganda campaigns, and how democratic cryptocurrencies could offer a permissionless analog of universal basic income.

					<b>Bio:</b> Prof. Bryan Ford leads the Decentralized/Distributed Systems (DEDIS) research group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).  Ford focuses broadly on building secure decentralized systems, touching on topics including private and anonymous communication, scalable decentralized systems, blockchain technology, Internet architecture, and operating systems.  Ford earned his B.S. at the University of Utah and his Ph.D. at MIT, then joined the faculty of Yale University where his work received the Jay Lepreau Best Paper Award and grants from NSF, DARPA, and ONR, including the NSF CAREER award.  His continuing work receives support from EPFL, the AXA Research Fund, and numerous industry partners.  He has served as a member of the DARPA Information Science and Technology (ISAT) study group, and is an advisory board member of the Swiss FinTech Innovations association.
