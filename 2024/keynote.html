						<p><b>Title</b>: Federated and Split Machine Learning in the Internet of Things </p>
						<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk we discuss approaches for distributed machine learning (ML) in resource-constrained edge-supported Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) are popular approaches in such wireless edge networks. First, we present Early Exit of Communication (EEoC), which adaptively splits ML inference in an IoT edge computing environment to meet latency and energy constraints. This layer-based (vertically partitioned) approach has been extended by Distributed Micro-Split Deep Learning in Heterogeneous Dynamic IoT (DISNET), which adds horizontal partitioning to better support flexible, distributed, and parallel execution of neural network models on heterogeneous IoT devices under dynamic conditions. Then, we also consider the training aspect by developing and evaluating Adaptive REsource-aware Split-learning (ARES), a scheme for efficient model training in IoT systems. Recent work suggests Dynamic FL (DFL) for heterogeneous IoT, which uses resource-aware SL and FL based on similarity-based layer-wise model aggregation.</p>

						<p><b>Title</b>: Powering the Next Generation Telco Networks with Privacy-Preserving AI</p>
						<p><b>Abstract:</b> As faster, more complex networks (5G, 6G, etc.) emerge, traditional telco network management solutions are reaching their limits, with respect to AI model performance, security and privacy protection, and fairness offered. At Telefonica, we explore cutting-edge methods using cloud infrastructure, hierarchical network structures, edge and end-user computing, and privacy-preserving AI models. In this talk, we will cover our recent efforts to develop secure, private, fair, and scalable systems to meet the demands of next-gen networks and applications.</p>

						<p><b>Bio</b>: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q5oWwiQAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Nicolas Kourtellis </a> is Head of the Systems AI Lab (SAIL) and Co-Director of Telefonica Research, a 25+ researcher team based in Barcelona, Spain. He holds a PhD in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of South Florida, USA (2012) and has over 90 published peer-reviewed papers and 8 filed patents. Currently, he focuses on privacy-preserving AI and federated learning on the edge, modeling/detecting with AI user online privacy leaks, as well as inappropriate/fraudulent behavior on social media. He executed several research visits in ANL (USA), INRIA (France), Yahoo (Spain/USA), UCL (UK), CUT (Cyprus), AUTH (Greece), FORTH (Greece), and others. He has served in many technical committees of top conferences and journals, and presented his work in top academic and industrial venues including Mobile World Congress 2021 and 2023, Apache Foundation, etc. His work has been covered by major news outlets such as Nature, New York Times, The Atlantic, New Scientist, Washington Post, Wired, and others.

					<b>Title:</b> Clubs, Coins, and Crowds: Fairness and Decentralization in Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies
				</div>
				<div class="row text-justify">
					<b>Abstract:</b> Building secure systems from independent, mutually distrustful parties is an old topic in computer science. But despite its attendant hype and misinformation, today's “blockchain bandwagon” has successfully brought the gospel of decentralization - both a realization of its possibility and an appreciation for its value - to mainstream society.  Currently-deployed blockchains, however, are slow, unscalable, weakly consistent, profligate in energy use, and have effectively re-centralized due to market pressures.  We will explore ongoing challenges and progress in rethinking blockchain architecture to improve scalability, efficiency, functionality, privacy, and decentralization.  We will explore how decentralized building blocks such as collective signatures and scalable distributed randomness enable architecturally modular solutions to challenges such as sharding, proof-of-stake, and blockchain-managed secrets.  Finally, we explore challenges in fairness and democratization in decentralized systems, how “proof-of-personhood” blockchains could enable information forums and anonymous reputation systems resistant to propaganda campaigns, and how democratic cryptocurrencies could offer a permissionless analog of universal basic income.

					<b>Bio:</b> Prof. Bryan Ford leads the Decentralized/Distributed Systems (DEDIS) research group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).  Ford focuses broadly on building secure decentralized systems, touching on topics including private and anonymous communication, scalable decentralized systems, blockchain technology, Internet architecture, and operating systems.  Ford earned his B.S. at the University of Utah and his Ph.D. at MIT, then joined the faculty of Yale University where his work received the Jay Lepreau Best Paper Award and grants from NSF, DARPA, and ONR, including the NSF CAREER award.  His continuing work receives support from EPFL, the AXA Research Fund, and numerous industry partners.  He has served as a member of the DARPA Information Science and Technology (ISAT) study group, and is an advisory board member of the Swiss FinTech Innovations association.
